# My third project

This language was a mixture of emotions between extremely confusing and 
incredibly easy, the best part was definitely the maths section. That was fun.
This project took a small bit of sweat and mabey a little tear, but it's done
now and working one hundred percent.

# Page layouts

This project has a simple design for ease of the user's experience, it is a 6x6 square
With the A-H on the x-axis and 1-6 on the y-axis. When inputting your answers, if the inputs are not in the range of what is asked the code will print Invalid and ask you to re input your answers

. This is how the project deals with any invalid inputs.

## User Experience

The game allows you to have ten tries before printing "you have run out of tries". This is a way to prevent an unpleasant experience for the user, not having to input 36 different inputs before being able to restart.

# Bugs

The absolute main difficulty I have had with this project was the inputs section. Trying to create a simple but effective input system proved to be extremely difficult, but with the help of some revised notes I managed to get there.

After that there was just the usual simple syntax errors and mabey some indentation errors nothing code wrecking or destroying and after all the struggle the site is fully complete.

# Deployment

With the assistance of Anna Greves tutorial on deployment, I managed to deploy my project through Heroku at this link, https://project3forcodeinstitute.herokuapp.com/.

## Media

The line of code here (print("%d|%s|" % (row_num, "|".join(x_axis)))) is not my own work. This was a bit of code I was stuck on and found on a Reddit thread of someone who also was experiencing the same problem I was. I am unable to find the link I had it saved, but has got lost along the lines.
